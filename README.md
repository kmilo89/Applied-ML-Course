## Project Guidelines and Evaluation Rubric

### General Description
Students must develop a Machine Learning project during the course.  
The final deliverables are:  
1. **Research Article (7–10 pages)** following an academic paper style (IEEE).  
2. **Final Presentation (Week 8)** with live Q&A.  

The project will be graded in stages, each with a defined weight.

## Part I: Written Report (Research Article) – 70%

The document must include the following:

- **(20%) Literature Review & State of the Art**  
  Synthesize high-quality sources (recent 5–10 years + seminal works). Compare and contrast methods and findings, identify convergences, contradictions, and explicit research gaps your work will address. Use consistent academic citations.

- **(15%) Research Question & Objectives**  
  Clearly state the research question and motivation grounded in the identified gap. Define SMART objectives (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound) aligned with the project scope.

- **(15%) Data & Preliminary Analysis**  
  Describe datasets, features (X), target (y), sampling, size, and data provenance. Include basic EDA (distributions, correlations), target balance, leakage checks, and justify the evaluation metric with respect to the objective.

- **(15%) Materials & Methods**  
  Detail preprocessing steps, feature engineering, model(s) and baselines, train/validation/test strategy, hyperparameter search and validation protocol (e.g., cross-validation), and reproducibility elements (random seeds, environment). Justify design choices.

- **(15%) Results**  
  Report quantitative results with appropriate metrics, tables/figures, and (when applicable) variability estimates (e.g., std/CI). Include ablations or comparisons against baselines to show incremental value.

- **(10%) Discussion**  
  Interpret results in context of the literature and objectives. Provide error analysis, limitations, threats to validity, and implications for deployment or future research.

- **(10%) Conclusions**  
  Concise takeaways that answer the research question, reflect on objective fulfillment, and outline concrete future work.

## Part II: Final Presentation – 30%

Each team will present their project in the last class (10 minutes + 3 minutes Q&A).

- **(20%) Time Management**  
  Deliver the presentation within the assigned time, focusing on the most relevant aspects.  

- **(20%) Language and Precision**  
  Use clear and technically accurate language when describing ML methods and results.  

- **(20%) Methodology Explanation**  
  Present the workflow and reasoning in a structured, logical order.  

- **(20%) Supporting Material**  
  Slides must support the talk (not replace it), highlighting results with appropriate visuals.  

- **(20%) Handling Questions**  
  Respond with confidence, technical rigor, and respect to the audience’s questions.
